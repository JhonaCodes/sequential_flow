## 1.1.0

### Added
- **Type-Safe Data Storage**: Generic `setData<K, V>()` and `getData<K, V>()` methods
  - Support for any key type: strings, enums, integers, custom objects
  - Type-safe retrieval with compile-time checking
  - Backward compatibility with string keys via `setString()` and `getString()`
- **Improved Back Navigation**: New `onBackPressed` callback for cleaner custom back handling
  - Separates navigation logic from UI rendering
  - Only executes when back button is actually pressed
  - No more side effects during widget rebuilds

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Replaced `onPressBack` with `onBackPressed` in `SequentialFlow`
  - `onPressBack` returned widgets and caused setState during build errors
  - `onBackPressed` is a void callback that executes logic only when needed
  - Migration: Move dialog logic from return statements to direct `showDialog()` calls
- **Enhanced API Design**: Separated concerns between UI rendering and navigation logic
  - `_FlowMainContent` now only handles state rendering
  - Back navigation is handled exclusively in `PopScope`
  - Cleaner, more predictable behavior

### Fixed
- **setState During Build**: Eliminated crashes caused by setState being called during widget build
- **Navigation Timing**: Back press handlers now execute at the correct time
- **Widget Lifecycle**: Proper separation of rendering and navigation concerns

### Improved
- **Developer Experience**: More intuitive API with clearer separation of responsibilities
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced compile-time checking for data storage operations
- **Documentation**: Updated examples to use new type-safe APIs
- **Error Prevention**: Architecture changes prevent common Flutter anti-patterns

### Migration Guide
```dart
// OLD (v1.0.0) - Caused setState during build errors
onPressBack: (controller) {
  return AlertDialog(
    title: Text('Cancel?'),
    actions: [
      TextButton(
        onPressed: () => controller.cancelFlow(),
        child: Text('Yes'),
      ),
    ],
  );
}

// NEW (v1.1.0) - Clean execution only when needed
onBackPressed: (controller) {
  showDialog(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
      title: Text('Cancel?'),
      actions: [
        TextButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.pop(context);
            controller.cancelFlow();
          },
          child: Text('Yes'),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}

// Type-safe data storage
// OLD
controller.setData('amount', 10.0);
double? amount = controller.getData('amount');

// NEW (recommended)
enum Keys { amount, method }
controller.setData(Keys.amount, 10.0);
double? amount = controller.getData<Keys, double>(Keys.amount);
```
